**All codes and data used in this paper are provided here for reproducibility.**

There are two ways to access the Paleobiology Database data used in this study. You may either open the pbdb.csv file for the interval of your choice in the Pbdb-files folder to access the processed dataset utilized here, or if you wish to download straight from the database, you may use R and start with 01_download_pbdb_new.R to download the raw dataset used in this study with instructions on how to process and clean that data in 02_AllCalcs.html.

The fossil occurrence analyes can be found and reproduced by opening 02_AllCalcs.html, which is accompanied by the source code 02_AllCalcs.qmd. The script for creating figures 2 and 3 are in 03_Differences-Figure3.html and 04_Stripes-Figure2.html and their accompanying .qmd files.

Access the studyâ€™s .Rdata object, containing all data and results, using: piggyback!

# This R code shows how to access a .Rdata file from a GitHub release using the piggyback package.
```
# 1. First install and load the piggyback package.
# 2. Create a temporary directory and download the default.RData file from the specified GitHub repository release version using the pb_download() function.
# 3. Finally, load the downloaded .Rdata file into the R environment using the load() function.

 install.packages(piggyback)
 require(piggyback)

 Create temporary directory and load .Rdata into R environment.
 pb_download(file = "default.RData",dest = tempdir(),repo = "jalaswad/end-Permian-Homogenization",tag = "v1.0.0")
 load(file = file.path(tempdir(),"default.RData"))

```
